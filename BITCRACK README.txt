This Python program calculate Private Key of compressed Public Key.

Conditions to get quick results:
1. You should have a valid Public Key
2. You should know the Private Key range you are looking for, if not, it will take some time to calculate the actual
private key based on the Public Key X & Y coordinates using scalar multiplication.


Requirements to Run:
1. Install Python 3.8,
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/
2. Copy the bitcrack code.
3. Run the program.

You don't need to do some coding, just install Python and run the program.
